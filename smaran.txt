notes for Operating system

OS have two major parts- Kernel and Application 
The link between the two is as follows:
The kernel provides a set of services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that 
\n <b>allow applications to access system resources such as memory, storage, and input/output devices.</b>

For example - 
1) when an application needs to write data to the hard drive, it sends a request to /n
the operating system kernel, which then handles the request and sends the appropriate /n
signals to the disk controller to write the data to the disk. 

2) Similarly, when an application needs to allocate memory, it sends a request to the kernel, /n
which then manages memory allocation and ensures that memory is properly assigned to the application.

Applicatio 

The application is a software program that runs on top of the operating system, 
and it provides users with a way to perform specific tasks or activities, such as creating a document, playing a video game, or browsing the web. 
Applications are designed to interact with the user and make use of the resources provided by the operating system, such as memory, CPU, storage, 
and input/output devices.
